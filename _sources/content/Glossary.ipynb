    "Throughout this course we will use a variety of different functions available in the base Python library, but also many other libraries in the scientific computing stack. Here we provide a list of all of the functions that are used across the various notebooks. It can be a helpful reference when you are learning Python about the types of things you can do with various packages. Remember you can always view the docstrings for any function by adding a `?` to the end of the function name."

    "## Jupyter Cell Magic\n",
    "Magics are specific to and provided by the IPython kernel. Whether Magics are available on a kernel is a decision that is made by the kernel developer on a per-kernel basis. To work properly, Magics must use a syntax element which is not valid in the underlying language. For example, the IPython kernel uses the `%` syntax element for Magics as `%` is not a valid unary operator in Python. However, `%` might have meaning in other languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "[%conda](https://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/interactive/magics.html#magic-conda): Run the conda package manager within the current kernel.\n",
    "\n",
    "[%debug](https://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/interactive/magics.html#magic-debug): Activate the interactive debugger. This magic command support two ways of activating debugger. One is to activate debugger before executing code. This way, you can set a break point, to step through the code from the point. You can use this mode by giving statements to execute and optionally a breakpoint. The other one is to activate debugger in post-mortem mode. You can activate this mode simply running %debug without any argument. If an exception has just occurred, this lets you inspect its stack frames interactively. Note that this will always work only on the last traceback that occurred, so you must call this quickly after an exception that you wish to inspect has fired, because if another one occurs, it clobbers the previous one.\n",
    "\n",
    "[%matplotlib](https://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/interactive/magics.html#magic-matplotlib): Set up matplotlib to work interactively. Example: ```%matplotlib inline```\n",

    "[enumerate](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#enumerate): Return an enumerate object. iterable must be a sequence, an iterator, or some other object which supports iteration. The __next__() method of the iterator returned by enumerate() returns a tuple containing a count (from start which defaults to 0) and the values obtained from iterating over iterable.\n",
    "\n",
    "[float](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#float): Return a floating point number constructed from a number or string x.\n",

    "\n",
    "[glob.glob](https://docs.python.org/3/library/glob.html): The glob module finds all the pathnames matching a specified pattern according to the rules used by the Unix shell, although results are returned in arbitrary order. No tilde expansion is done, but `*`, `?`, and character ranges expressed with `[]` will be correctly matched. This is done by using the `os.scandir()` and `fnmatch.fnmatch()` functions in concert, and not by actually invoking a subshell. \n",

This is the second element of the pair returned by passing path to the function split(). Note that the result of this function is different from the Unix basename program; where basename for '/foo/bar/' returns 'bar', the basename() function returns an empty string ('').\n",
    "\n",
    "[os.path.join](https://docs.python.org/2/library/os.path.html#os.path.join): Join one or more path components intelligently. The return value is the concatenation of path and any members of paths with exactly one directory separator (os.sep) following each non-empty part except the last, meaning that the result will only end in a separator if the last part is empty. If a component is an absolute path, all previous components are thrown away and joining continues from the absolute path component.\n",

    "[str](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#func-str): For more information on static methods, see [The standard type hierarchy](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#types).\n",
    "\n",
