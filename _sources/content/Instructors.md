[Wasita Mahaphanit](https://wasita.space/) (Fall 2022) graduated from Brown University with a BS in Cognitive Neuroscience. She managed a lab at Brown after graduation, where she investigated the behavioral and computational mechanisms underlying learning and decision-making under uncertainty in healthy adults and patients with obsessive compulsive disorder. She currently works in the [COSAN Lab](http://cosanlab.com/), where she studies how we learn social cognitive maps and use this information in how we communicate and make decisions.
